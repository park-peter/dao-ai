    Configuration parameters for the DAO AI agent.

    This TypedDict defines external configuration parameters that can be passed
    to the agent during invocation. It allows for runtime customization of the
    agent's behavior without changing the agent's code.

    Example configurations might include:
    - user_id: Identifier for the current user
    - store_id: Identifier for the relevant DAO store location
    - thread_id: Conversation thread identifier for stateful conversations
    - product_categories: Categories to filter for in product searches

    passed between nodes in the agent graph and modified during execution.
